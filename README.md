# LaTeX-Template
Template for LaTeX

## Programs for editing
You can use the collaborative cloud-based LaTeX editor Overleaf for this template.


## Note
If you upload the files directly to Overleaf, please make sure that the folder structure remains. Overleaf does not support to keep the folder structure when uploading, so it has to be done manually.
